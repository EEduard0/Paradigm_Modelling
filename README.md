Theoretical paradigm modelling is an emerging interdisciplinary approach aimed at uncovering and reconfiguring the foundational assumptions that underlie existing scientific models. At its core, it seeks to identify the deep cognitive, cultural, and systemic paradigms that shape how knowledge is generated, interpreted, and applied within and across disciplines. This method doesn't merely critique current models—it actively simulates the emergence of alternative conceptual frameworks through computational, cognitive, and empirical techniques. By integrating insights from cognitive science, artificial intelligence, complexity theory, and systems thinking, theoretical paradigm modelling aspires to make visible the otherwise implicit rules that govern how science is done, and to explore the space of "what could be" beyond the confines of entrenched paradigms.

This kind of modelling holds significant promise for improving and expanding science. Traditional scientific disciplines often evolve incrementally within the boundaries of dominant paradigms, as Thomas Kuhn famously argued in The Structure of Scientific Revolutions. Theoretical paradigm modelling, however, provides a meta-level mechanism for facilitating more radical, systematic shifts in understanding. By modelling the conditions under which paradigms evolve—such as technological innovation, environmental collapse, or shifts in societal values—it enables scientists to anticipate transformative changes before they occur. Additionally, it opens the possibility for intentional paradigm design, where future scientific trajectories are guided not just by data, but by adaptive frameworks that can accommodate novelty, uncertainty, and complexity. This could enhance the agility, creativity, and responsiveness of science in the face of global crises.

As a field, theoretical paradigm modelling is still in its formative stages, making it both novel and revolutionary. It represents a synthesis rather than a single discipline—more akin to a science of sciences or a meta-theoretical platform—that brings together diverse methods and epistemologies to map and steer the evolution of knowledge itself. Unlike traditional sciences that study phenomena within fixed frameworks, paradigm modelling is concerned with the evolution of those frameworks themselves. In this sense, it is a new science, but one that stands on the shoulders of many others. Its novelty lies not in discarding established science, but in enabling a more reflective, adaptive, and systemic practice of science that is capable of evolving in step with the world it seeks to understand.

1. Cognitive-Ecological Interaction Model (CEIM)

- Explores how individual cognitive biases interact with environmental feedback loops to drive shifts in collective belief systems.

2. Multi-Scale Adaptive Systems Model (MASM)

- Simulates paradigm evolution across nested scales of organization, from individual agents to global institutions, incorporating nonlinear dynamics.

3. Neuro-Social Plasticity Model (NSPM)

- Integrates findings from neuroscience and sociology to map how neural plasticity and social structures co-evolve, leading to paradigm reconfiguration.

4. Techno-Cultural Resonance Model (TCRM)

- Examines the feedback cycles between emerging technologies and cultural narratives to predict and explain paradigm shifts.

5. Evolutionary Constraint-Release Model (ECRM)

- Models how evolutionary pressures suppress or release innovative paradigms through mechanisms of constraint, competition, and environmental perturbation.
